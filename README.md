# Bedrock Liteloader Handler
A handler which allows BDS(bedrock dedicated server) with liteloader modded to use MCDR and its massive plugins.

## Before you use
Since Bedrock and Java edition are different in many aspects, so read the introductions of other MCDR plugins you want to use and make sure them would work correctly before you place them into plugins directory.
## Usage
1. Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/Elec-Glacier/liteloader_handler/releases)
2. Place this plugin in your MCDR "plugins" directory
3. Start MCDR

## Attentions
Due to a [BDS bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/BDS-3791), you might need to use some server modified plugins to let MCDR work correctly, such as [UnicodeFixer](https://www.minebbs.com/resources/unicodefixer.6991/).
